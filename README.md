# Document Management Utility ‚Äì Group Policy Portal

## üß© Overview
This .NET-based internal utility was developed to simplify document access for **Operations users** handling **Group Policy Holders**.

1. **User Input** ‚Äì Operations team enters a valid **Member ID**.  
2. **Fetch Process** ‚Äì System queries the document repository for all records linked to that Member ID.  
3. **Tree View Generation** ‚Äì Documents are grouped by categories (Basic Details, Endorsement Details, etc.) and displayed hierarchically.  
4. **Download Option** ‚Äì Clicking on any document name triggers a **secure download** through the backend handler.
