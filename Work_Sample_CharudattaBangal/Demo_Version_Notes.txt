## ðŸ”’ Demo Version Notes

This repository contains a **sanitized demonstration version** of an internal utility developed during my professional experience.

The original project involved **secure API integrations and data exchange mechanisms** with confidential endpoints.  
Due to company data protection policies, the **actual API keys, endpoint URLs, database schemas, and business data** cannot be shared publicly.

**However, this demo version includes:**
- The **complete business logic** and application flow (`Searchdocuments.aspx.cs`, `ResponsePage.aspx.cs`)
- All **structural layers** (`App_Code`, `Helpers`, `Models`, `UI`, and `BusinessLogic`)
- **Representative placeholder code** for API requests and data handling (non-confidential)
- **Screenshots** of the working interface for reference

**Not included / redacted:**
- Proprietary API endpoints and authentication logic  
- Encrypted connection strings and data access credentials  
- Any company-specific domain logic or naming conventions  

Other than the above, **this demo accurately represents the architecture, structure, and functionality** of the original project I worked on.
